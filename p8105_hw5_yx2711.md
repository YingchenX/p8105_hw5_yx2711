# Problem 1

Use the `list.files()` function to create the dataframe containing all
file names. Use the `map()` function to iterate file names, read in the
data, and save the result as `full_df`.

``` r
full_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("hw5_data/data/"),
    path = str_c("hw5_data/data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

Tidy the results using `mutate()` and `pivot_longer()`.

``` r
tidy_df = 
  full_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(group, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing each subject overtime.

``` r
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

There is a within-subject correlation. Subjects in the control groups do
not have a specific trend in change overtime, while subjects in the
experimental group have a linear increase in general.
